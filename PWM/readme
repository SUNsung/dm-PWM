PWM controller module on mosfet with driver.
  logic level: 12V

Implemented by:
- dual position indicator of the driver;
- control of input voltage;
- control of the output voltage;
- temperature control on the thermistor;
- set the RC filter at the output;
- output of the external cooler control from the logic level power supply bus;
